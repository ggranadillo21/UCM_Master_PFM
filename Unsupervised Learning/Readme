Unsupervised Learning

This folder contains the Python source code of the unsupervised learning algorithms (i.e., Local Outlier Factor, Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Autoencoders and K-Means) 
used for anomaly detection in NetFlow traffic using the CIDDS dataset. 

The best results are obtained with Autoencoders, the model is also saved as a .pkl file

'muestra1.csv' is used to train and test all algorithms except for Autoencoders that needed one dataset for training (with no anomalies) and another dataset for testing (with anomalies)

Autoencoders used 'train_CIDDS.csv' for training and muestra1.csv for testing
